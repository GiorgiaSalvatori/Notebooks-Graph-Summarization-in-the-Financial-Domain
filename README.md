# Notebooks-Graph-Summarization-in-the-Financial-Domain
* **Random-Graph** this notebook permits the creation of the random graph (directed and weighted) used in the experimental phase. Further it contains:
    - the $l_2RE$ algorithm to build both the summary graph and the recontruction graph given in input the random graph.
    - statistics over the summary and reconstruction graphs.
    - the creation of the possible world set.
    - all the queries reported in the thesis using Na誰ve-GPQP and Probabilistic-GPQP approaches on the summary graph.
 * **Riondato-real-graph** this notebook is about the real graphs used for the experimental analysis:LastFM, Facebook, Enron, Ubuntu and Gnutella. Further it contains:
    - the  $l_2RE$ algorithm to build both the summary graph and the recontruction graph given in input a real graph.
    - statistics over the summary and reconstruction graphs.
    - all the queries reported in the thesis using Na誰ve-GPQP approach on the summary graph.
 * **Riondato-syn-graph** this notebook permits the creation of the edge lists of the transaction graphs syntethically generated. Further it contains:
    - the  $l_2RE$ algorithm to build both the summary graph and the recontruction graph given in input a synthetic transaction graph.
    - statistics over the summary and reconstruction graphs.
    - all the queries reported in the thesis using Na誰ve-GPQP approach on the summary graph.
 * **SWeG** this notebook contains the summary graphs generated by SWeG algorithm given in input the three simple graphs LastFM, Facebook and Enron. Further it contains:
    - the creation of the supernodes dictionary.
    - statistics over the summary and reconstruction graphs.
    - all the queries reported in the thesis using Na誰ve-GPQP approach on the summary graphs.
* **UncertainGraphs** this notebook contains the summary graphs generated by $l_2RE$ algorithm given in input the real graphs LastFM, Facebook, Enron, Ubuntu and Gnutella and the synthetic transaction graphs. Further it contains:
    - the creation of the possible world set.
    - all the queries (single value and set queries) reported in the thesis using Probabilistic-GPQP approach on the summary graphs.
